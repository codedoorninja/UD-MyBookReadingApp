# MyReads Project

## This is the MyReads Project from my Udacity React course

Books are beeing displayed seperated on the "shelfes" they are stored in. Books can be moved from one shelf to another or can be removed from the shelfes. On a search page new Books can be added to the shelfes. In Addition to the project specifications I added a simple test to only run search on books with search string >= 3 for performance reasons.

## Install / start

Just install with 
`npm install`
and start with 
`npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
